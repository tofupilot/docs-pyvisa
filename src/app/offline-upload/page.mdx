# Offline upload

Upload your test results at any time after their execution. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

TofuPilot allows you to upload your test results in real-time, but you might also need to upload them asynchronouslyâ€”for example, if you're not connected to the internet during testing or to bulk import data from previous tests.

## Integration

With the TofuPilot Python Client, you can upload test results, specifying `started_at` to keep the original test date; otherwise, the upload date will apply. Then use `create_run` to add test details or attachments.

Or you can use `create_report_from_openhtf_record` to upload your OpenHTF JSON record to TofuPilot.

<CodeGroup>
```python {{ title: 'Python Client'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

client = TofuPilotClient()

def load_your_results():

# Convert a date string into a datetime object in the UTC timezone

date_string = "25-10-2024 14:30"
started_at = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M").replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)
return started_at

def main():
started_at = load_your_results()

response = client.create_run(
procedure_id = "FVT1",
started_at = started_at # datetime object
unit_under_test = {
"serial_number": "PCB1A001",
"part_number": "PCB1",
},
run_passed = True,
attachments=["path/to/your/attachment"],
)

```python {{ title: 'OpenHTF'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient

client = TofuPilotClient()

def main():
    file_path = "path/to/your/openhtf/report.json"
    client.create_run_from_openhtf_report(file_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
````

Uploaded runs then appear on the Runs page with their upload date.
