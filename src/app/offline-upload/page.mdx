# Offline upload

Upload your test results at any time after their execution. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

TofuPilot allows you to upload your test results in real-time, but you might also need to upload them asynchronouslyâ€”for example, if you're not connected to the internet during testing or to bulk import data from previous tests.

## Integration

With the TofuPilot Python Client, you can upload test results, specifying `started_at` to keep the original test date; otherwise, the upload date will apply. Then use `create_run` to add test details or attachments.

<CodeGroup>

```python {{ title: 'OpenHTF'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient

client = TofuPilotClient()

def main():
    file_path = "path/to/your/openhtf/report.json"
    client.create_run_from_openhtf_report(file_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python {{ title: 'Python Client'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient

client = TofuPilotClient()

def main():
  response = client.create_run(
    procedure_id = "FVT1",
    unit_under_test = {
      "serial_number": "PCB1A001",
      "part_number": "PCB1",
    },
    run_passed = True,
    attachments=["path/to/your/attachment"],
  )

```

</CodeGroup>

Uploaded runs then appear on the Runs page with their upload date.

The Run page shows the **started** date of the test. These two runs have been started the same day (e.g. `started_at` October 28th) even if they have been uploaded different days.
