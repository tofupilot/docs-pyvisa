# Offline upload

Upload your test results at any time after their execution. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

TofuPilot allows you to upload your test results in real-time, but you might also need to upload them asynchronouslyâ€”for example, if you're not connected to the internet during testing or to bulk import data from previous tests.

## Integration

With the TofuPilot Python Client, you can upload test results, specifying `started_at` to keep the original test date; otherwise, the upload date will apply. Then use `create_run` to add test details or attachments.

Uploaded runs then appear on the Runs page with their upload date.

The Run page shows the **started** date of the test. These two runs have been started the same day (e.g. `started_at` October 28th) even if they have been uploaded different days.
