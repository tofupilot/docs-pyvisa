## Overview

TofuPilot accounts are hosted on our AWS-powered cloud, managed by our team. This ensures strong security, high performance, automatic updates, and removes the need for your infrastructure management.

For strict IT policies or specific connectivity needs, TofuPilot can be self-hosted. Installation should take around 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites

### Enterprise trial

Contact [our team](mailto:support@tofupilot.com) to sign up for an **Enterprise** plan trial. We will grant you access to the private self-hosting installation repository.

All the tests stored in your TofuPilot Cloud instance can be seamlessly migrated to your self-hosted version by our team.

### System Requirements

Ensure your server meets the minimum specifications.

- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later (64-bit)
- **CPU**: 2 cores or more
- **RAM**: 4 GB or more
- **Storage**: 20 GB of free disk space, or more depending on your run attachments needs
- **Access**: Sudo access to your server.
- **Network**: Open ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)

### Domains

Ensure your domain and DNS settings are prepared for self-hosting:

- **Domain Name**: Register a domain or subdomain for TofuPilot (e.g., `tofupilot.yourcompany.com`).
- **Storage Domain Name**: Register a subdomain for TofuPilot storage (e.g., `storage.tofupilot.yourcompany.com`).
- **DNS Records**: Create two A records in your DNS settings:
  - Point `tofupilot.yourcompany.com` to your server's public IPv4 address.
  - Point `storage.tofupilot.yourcompany.com` to the same public IPv4 address.
- **SSL Certificate**: Ensure you have a valid email address for registering the SSL certificate with Letâ€™s Encrypt.

## Authentication

TofuPilot does not store user passwords in its database and offers two secure methods for user sign-up and authentication:

1. **Email Authentication**: Users sign in by receiving a magic code sent to their email.
2. **OAuth Authentication**: Users sign in using their Microsoft or Google accounts.

You must enable **at least one** authentication method based on your requirements.

### Email

To enable email-based authentication, retrieve the following SMTP server details:

- **SMTP Host**: The hostname of your email server (e.g., `smtp.yourdomain.com`).
- **SMTP Port**: Typically `587` for TLS or `465` for SSL.
- **Email From Address**: The email address that will send the magic codes (e.g., `auth@yourdomain.com`).
- **SMTP User**: The username for your email account (e.g., `auth@yourdomain.com`).
- **SMTP Password**: The password or app-specific password for your email account.

To enable OAuth authentication, create an authorized application in your Google or Microsoft account:

### Microsoft OAuth

1. Go to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** > Manage > **App registrations**.
3. Register a new application with these details:
   - **Redirect URI**: e.g. `https://tofupilot.yourcompany.com/api/auth/callback/azure-ad`
   - Set **Supported Account Types** to match your needs (e.g., single tenant or multi-tenant).
4. After registration, retrieve the following:
   - **Application (client) ID**
   - **Directory (tenant) ID**
   - **Client Secret**: Create a client secret under **Certificates & secrets**.

### Google OAuth

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID under **Credentials**.
3. Configure the following:
   - **Authorized Redirect URI**: `https://tofupilot.yourcompany.com/api/auth/callback/google`
4. Retrieve the following:
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret**

## Deploy

Once prerequisites are complete, installation is straightforward.

1. SSH into your server:

   ```bash
   ssh user@your_server_ip
   ```

2. Download the deployment script `deploy.sh` from the installation repository provided by our team.

3. Configure the deployment script:

   ```bash
   nano ~/deploy.sh
   ```

4. Locate and replace the following lines:

   ```bash
   DOMAIN_NAME=""
   EMAIL=""
   STORAGE_DOMAIN_NAME="storage.$DOMAIN_NAME" # or another

   # Ensure at least one auth method (Azure AD, Google OAuth, or SMTP) is configured.
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=""
   AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID=""
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=""

   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""

   SMTP_HOST=""
   SMTP_PORT="587"
   SMTP_USER=""
   SMTP_PASSWORD=""
   EMAIL_FROM=""
   ```

5. Run the deployment script:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/deploy.sh
   sudo bash deploy.sh
   ```

## Post-Installation

Once the script finishes, access the web app (e.g., `tofupilot.yourcompany.com`) to create an admin account, and set up an organization (we recommend naming it `app`).

You can upload test runs using the public TofuPilot Python package. Simply set your instance URL with the `url` parameter as shown below. All features described in the rest of the documentation will function as expected.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python {{ title: 'OpenHTF'}}
    import openhtf as htf
    from tofupilot.openhtf import TofuPilot

    def main():
         test = htf.Test(
               procedure_id="FVT1",
               procedure_name="PCB Testing",
               part_number="PCB1",
         )
         with TofuPilot(test, url="https://tofupilot.yourcompany.com"): # specify URL here
         test.execute(lambda: "PCB1A001")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
         main()
    ```

    ```python {{ title: 'Python'}}
    from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    def main():
        client = TofuPilotClient(url="https://tofupilot.yourcompany.com") # specify URL here

        client.create_run(
            procedure_id="FVT1",
            procedure_name="PCB Testing",
            run_passed=True,
            unit_under_test={
                "serial_number": "PCB1A001",
                "part_number": "PCB1"},
            duration=timedelta(minutes=1, seconds=45),
        )

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
    ```

## Update

To update your self-hosted TofuPilot app to the latest version, run the update script:

```bash
chmod +x ~/update.sh
sudo bash update.sh
```
