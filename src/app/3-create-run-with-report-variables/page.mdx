# Create a run with report variables

Each run in TofuPilot includes a Report section with a robust, collaborative editor. Runs inherit the report from their Procedure, which can be modified as needed.

## Create report template variables

Insert variables into a procedure report template by wrapping their name in \{\{ }}. These fields become customizable inputs.

## Fill variables programmatically

Create a run from the procedure and use the "report_variables" parameter to populate the variables fields.

```python {{ title: 'create_run_report_variables.py'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient
import time

client = TofuPilotClient(api_key="Your API key goes here")

def test_function():
    # Your test execution goes here
    time.sleep(1)
    return True

client.create_run(
    procedure_id="FVT1",
    unit_under_test={
      "part_number": "ASY01",
      "serial_number": "00001"
    },
    smart_fields={
      "temperature_sensor": "75°C",
      "calibration_date": "2024-06-20",
      "technician_name": "John Doe",
      "initial_temperature_reading": "72°C",
      "final_temperature_reading": "75°C",
    },
    test_function=test_function
)
```

## Check your run report

Access the newly created run's report and observe the automatic population of the smart fields.

<Note>
  Smart fields work in any block of the editor (lists, tables, code blocks, and
  more), so use them anywhere you like.
