## Overview
TofuPilot allows you to upload your data in real-time, but you might also need to upload your data asynchronouslyâ€”for example, if you're not connected to the internet during testing or to bulk import past test data.


## Integration
You can upload test data anytime, specifying `started_at` to keep the original test date; otherwise, the upload date will apply. Use `create_run` to add test details or attachments with TofuPilot Python Client, or `create_report_from_openhtf_record` to upload your OpenHTF JSON record on TofuPilot.

```python {{ title: 'Python Client'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

client = TofuPilotClient()

# Convert a date string into a datetime object in the UTC timezone
def convert_your_results():
  date_string = "25-10-2024 14:30"
  started_at = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M").replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)
  return started_at

def main():
  started_at = convert_your_results()

  response = client.create_run(
    procedure_id = "FVT1",
    started_at = started_at # datetime object
    unit_under_test = {
      "serial_number": "PCB1A001",
      "part_number": "PCB1",
    },
    run_passed = True,
    attachments=["path/to/your/attachment"],
  )
```

Uploaded runs then appear on the Runs page with their upload date.
