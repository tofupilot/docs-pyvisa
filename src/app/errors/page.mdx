# Errors

In this guide, we will talk about what happens when something goes wrong while you work with the API. Let's look at some status codes and error types you might encounter. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  You can tell if your request was successful by checking the status code when
  receiving an API response. If a response comes back unsuccessful, you can use
  the error type and error message to figure out what has gone wrong and do some
  rudimentary debugging.

## Status codes

Here is a list of the different categories of status codes returned by the TofuPilot API. Use these to understand if a request was successful.

<Properties>
  <Property name="2xx">
    A 2xx status code indicates a successful response.
  </Property>
  <Property name="4xx">
    A 4xx status code indicates a client error — this means it's a _you_
    problem.
  </Property>
  <Property name="5xx">
    A 5xx status code indicates a server error — you won't be seeing these.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Error types

    Whenever a request is unsuccessful, the TofuPilot API will return an error response with an error message. You can use this information to understand better what has gone wrong and how to fix it. Most of the error messages are pretty helpful and actionable.

    {/* Here is a list of the two error types supported by the TofuPilot API — use these to understand what you have done wrong.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="api_error">
        This means that we made an error.
      </Property>
      <Property name="invalid_request">
        This means that you made an error.
      </Property>
