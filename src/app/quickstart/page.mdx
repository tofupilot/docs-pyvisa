### Create API Key

To allow your test scripts to securely authenticate with TofuPilot and upload data, you need to create an API key.

1. Navigate to **User Profile** ‚Üí **My Profile** page.
2. Create your API key in the dedicated section.

## First Test Run

1. Open your preferred Python development environment. We recommend using **virtualenv** for isolated Python environments. Learn how to set it up for:
   [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_virtual-environments),
   [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html),
   [Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Virtualenv).

2. Install the TofuPilot package:

```bash
pip install tofupilot
```

3. Retrieve your API key from the app and save it as an environment variable:

```bash
export TOFUPILOT_API_KEY="<Copy your API key here>"
```

4. Create a new test script and copy the following code:

```python {{ title: 'create_run.py'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient
from datetime import datetime

client = TofuPilotClient()

# Test function
def test():
    return True

# Run test function
start_time = datetime.now()
run_passed = test()
end_time = datetime.now()

# Create a test run
client.create_run(
    procedure_id="FVT1",
    unit_under_test={
      "serial_number": "PCBA01-0001",
      "part_number": "PCBA01"
    },
    run_passed=run_passed,
    duration=end_time - start_time
)
```

5. Run the script:

```bash
python create_run.py
```

The console returns:

```plaintext
TofuPilot Python Client <version>
2024-07-24 16:44:18 - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Creating run...
2024-07-24 16:44:19 - ‚úÖ Test run created: https://tofupilot.com/<organization>/runs/<uuid>
```

Your first run has been created on TofuPilot, congratulations! üéâ

## Run Page

You can open the link returned by the console with `Ctrl` / `Cmd` + `Click` or navigate to the Run page directly.

The Run page has been populated with your first run's information such as:

<Image src={'/run-first-upload.png'} alt={'First Run'} />

Here's the breakdown of what happened:

1. The `create_run` function used the TofuPilot REST API with your API key.
2. A new run was created for the `FVT1` test procedure.
3. The unit `PCBA01-0001` was created.
4. The unit was linked to component `PCBA01`.
5. The default revision `A` was assigned to the component.
6. The run status was set to `Pass` since `run_passed` is `True`.
7. The execution duration was `< 1s`.

## What's Next

Congratulations on uploading your first test run to TofuPilot! This simple test is just the beginning. The next guides will show you how to add essential options like test steps, attachments, and more.
