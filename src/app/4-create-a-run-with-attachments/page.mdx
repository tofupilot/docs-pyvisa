# Create a run with attachments

You may sometimes need to attach images, graphs, or reports to your runs. TofuPilot includes a built-in feature called “attachments” that makes this easy. To use this feature, simply add one parameter when creating a run. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Example

Here's how to create a test run with a graph and a report attached to it:

```python {{ title: 'create_run_with_attachments.py'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient
import time

client = TofuPilotClient(api_key="Your API key goes here")

def test_function():
    # Your test execution goes here
    time.sleep(1)

    run_passed = True
    attachments=[
      '/mnt/data/temperature-map.png',
      '/mnt/data/performance-report.pdf'
    ]
    return run_passed, attachments

run_passed, attachments = test_function()

client.create_run(
    procedure_id="FVT1",
    unit_under_test={
      "serial_number": "00102",
      "part_number": "PCB01"
    },
    run_passed=run_passed,
    attachments=attachments
)
```

## Check the new Run

You can now navigate to the Runs page to see your newly created run. It's attachments are visible under the _Attachments_ section

<Note>
  You can add, download, or delete any attachments for a run at any time in this
  section.
