# Attachments

Manufacturing tests often generate more than just status or test steps; they can produce logs, pictures, PDFs, and more. Tofupilot provides an option to easily upload these files with the test runs. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This guide shows how to attach one or several files during the creation of a run in Tofupilot and view them on the Run page.

## Example

To log test attachments, this script defines a test function, captures its results along with associated files, and uploads them to the `attachments` field in `create_run`.

```python {{ title: 'create_run_with_attachments.py'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient
import json
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

client = TofuPilotClient()

def generate_json_file():
    with open('test_result.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump({"test_result": "pass", "details": {"measurement": "temperature", "value": 23.5}}, f)

def generate_temperature_graph():
    plt.plot([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [22, 23, 23.5, 24, 23.8, 23.5])
    plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
    plt.ylabel('Temperature (C)')
    plt.title('Temperature Sensor Measurements')
    plt.savefig('temperature-map.png')

def test_function():
    generate_json_file()
    generate_temperature_graph()
    return True, ['temperature-map.png', 'test_result.json']

run_passed, attachments = test_function()

client.create_run(
    procedure_id="FVT1",
    unit_under_test={
        "serial_number": "00102",
    },
    run_passed=run_passed,
    attachments=attachments
)
```

## Run Page

A dedicated **Attachments** section is automatically created on the Runâ€™s page.

Attachments can be viewed in the browser or downloaded.
