# Create a run with attachments

You can attach any file to a Run, such as images, graphs, or reports, by simply linking their local path during run creation. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Example

Here's how to create a Run with a graph and a report attached:

```python {{ title: 'create_run_with_attachments.py'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient
import time

client = TofuPilotClient(api_key="Your API key goes here")

def test_function():
    # test status
    run_passed = True
    # local path to attachements
    attachments=[
      'temperature-map.png', # path to your local files
      'performance-report.pdf'
    ]
    return run_passed, attachments

run_passed, attachments = test_function()

client.create_run(
    procedure_id="FVT1",
    unit_under_test={
      "serial_number": "00102",
      "part_number": "PCB01"
    },
    run_passed=run_passed,
    attachments=attachments
)
```

## Check the new Run

Navigate to the Runs page to see your new run and its attachments under the Attachments section.

<Note>
  After upload, attachments can be manually downloaded, added, or deleted at any
  time.
