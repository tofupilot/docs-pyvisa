# Attachments

## Overview
Hardware tests often generate extra data, like images, that can't be captured as measurements. TofuPilot uploads these attachments, allowing you to access and download them directly from your workspace.

## Integration
You can add attachments using OpenHTF's `attach` or `attach_from_file` functions. With TofuPilot Client, use the `attachments` field when creating a run with `create_run`.

```python {{ title: 'OpenHTF' }}
import openhtf as htf
from tofupilot.openhtf import TofuPilot

def step_file_attachment(test):
    test.attach_from_file("/path/to/your/logfile.png")
    return htf.PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    test = htf.Test(phase_file_attachment, procedure_id="FVT1", part_number="PCB1")
    with TofuPilot(test):
      test.execute(lambda: "PCBA1A001")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python {{ title: 'Python' }}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient

def step_file_attachment():
    file_path = ["/path/to/your/file.png"]
    return file_path

def main():
    client = TofuPilotClient()

    attachments = step_file_attachment()

    client.create_run(
        procedure_id="FVT1",
        unit_under_test={
            "serial_number": "PCBA1A001",
            "part_number": "PCB1"
        },
        run_passed=True,
        attachments=attachments,
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## In-app view

A dedicated **Attachments** section is automatically created on the Runâ€™s page. Attachments can be viewed in the browser or downloaded.
