# Manufacturing Test Traceability & Analytics

Frameworks like OpenHTF standardize tests scripts and reporting. As production scales, you need strong test data management to maintain traceability and ensure performance and quality. {{ className: 'lead' }}

As a test engineer, you may already be using frameworks like OpenHTF to standardize how tests are written and to ensure a consistent log format. This is a great first step to scaling your testing infrastructure and maintaining product quality.

But to truly optimize your process, you also need to ensure traceability of the parts tested and continuous monitoring of test performance. Here's where **test data management** tools like [TofuPilot](https://tofupilot.com) comes in, offering a plug-and-play solution for managing your OpenHTF test reports at scale. It provides a secure cloud workspace for all your test data, accessible only by your team. For teams managing their own infrastructure, there's also an on-premises option.

## Test Traceability

While ERP or MES systems typically handle traceability for parts purchasing and shipment, the automatic test process is often disconnected. Local test logs contain valuable information that gets lost if not properly managed.

Test traceability answers key questions like:

- Was this serial number tested? How many times? Did it pass the first time?
- What part number and revision was it?
- When and where was the test done?

## Test Performances

Tracking and optimizing test performance is crucial as production scales. By monitoring key metrics, you can identify inefficiencies, improve throughput, and maintain product quality. Key test performance metrics include:

- **First-pass yield (FPY)**: Percentage of units passing tests without re-test or rework.

- **Cycle time**: Time spent per test cycle.

- **Process capability**: Measures test results against limits.

## TofuPilot + OpenHTF = Complete Test Management

### How it works

TofuPilot is designed to **seamlessly integrate with OpenHTF**.
Importing test data is simple: integrate directly into your OpenHTF scripts with the open-source TofuPilot Python client.

```python
from tofupilot import Tofupilot

// better example here

TofuPilotClient().import_log(file_path='path/to/your/openhtf/log.json')
```

You can also import test data from any language or file format using the [REST API](https://docs.tofupilot.com/api).

### Build It Yourself vs. Tofupilot

If you want to compute these analytics, you could create your own algorithms using Excel, custom logging solutions, or in-house scripts. However, this approach has several drawbacks:

- 💰 **High Costs**: Custom development is expensive and time-consuming.
- 🐢 **Low Performance**: Handling large data volumes can slow things down.
- 🛠️ **Maintenance**: Keeping custom tools updated is costly and tedious.
- 🚫 **Focus Shift**: Instead of improving test stations, you're spending time building tools
- 🔓 **Security Risks**: Sensitive data may be exposed due to improper permissions, especially on supplier systems.
