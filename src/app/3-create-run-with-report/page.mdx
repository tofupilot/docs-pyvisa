# Create run with report

Each run in TofuPilot has a **Report** section powered by a collaborative and strong editor. Upon creation, run's inherit from the report of their Procedure and can then be freely modified. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Populate run's report dynamically with smart fields

To create a procedure report template, you can insert smart fields by wrapping any variable in \{\{ }}. These fields will be converted into customizable inputs. {{ className: 'lead' }}

### Example {{ id: 'example' }}

1. Open the procedure’s page and create the report template, incorporating smart fields.

2. Create a run from the procedure and use the “smart_fields” parameter to populate the smart fields.

```python
  client.create_run({
    # other parameters here
    smart_fields: {
      "temperature_sensor": "75°C",
      "calibration_date": "2024-06-20",
      "technician_name": "John Doe",
      "initial_temperature_reading": "72°C",
      "final_temperature_reading": "75°C",
    }
  })
```

3. Access the newly created run's report and observe the automatic population of the smart fields.

<Note>
  **Pro Tip**: Smart fields work in all parts of the editor (lists, tables, code
  blocks, etc.), so use them anywhere you like.
