## Flowchart

You can create a test flowchart to give the manufacturing test and external teams an overview of the product's testbenches. This setup quickly shows available test benches, highlights missing tests, and eases team discussions.

### Example

In gray, list the parts (name and `part_number`) that make up the final product, tested or not. In blue, show production or assembly steps, noting the supplier or if done internally. In green, list procedures (with `procedure_id` and `procedure_name`) and mark each test as manual or automatic. Finally, connect the assembled components.

In this example of a smart-battery testing strategy:

- **PCBA**: a firmware flash and test is performed at the supplier to verify the integrated components (gauge, LEDs...).
- **Chemical Cells**: a test is performed on the battery cells to check voltage levels.
- **Thermal Probes**: no tests are performed for thermal probes that are purchased off-the-shelf.
- **Smart Battery Assembly**: a test is performed after final assembly to ensure proper integration of all components.
