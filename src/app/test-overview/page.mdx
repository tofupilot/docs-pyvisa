## Introduction

A good industrial test strategy relies on several key steps:

- **Early Test Deployment**: Install tests early at the supplier or assembler, matching each assembly stage.
- **Automated Tests**: Prioritize automation to reduce errors and save time.
- **Standardization and Log Collection**: Standardize logs and systematically collect results.

## Flowchart Example

A test flowchart can be created to provide the manufacturing test team with an overview of the product's testbenches.

In this example of a smart-battery testing strategy:

- **PCBA**: a firmware flash and test is performed at the supplier to verify the integrated components (gauge, LEDs...).
- **Chemical Cells**: a test is performed on the battery cells to check voltage levels.
- **Thermal Probes**: no tests are performed for thermal probes that are purchased off-the-shelf.
- **Smart Battery Assembly**: a test is performed after final assembly to ensure proper integration of all components.
