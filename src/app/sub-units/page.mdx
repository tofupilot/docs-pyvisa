## Overview

Most hardware products are made of multiple components, tested individually and at each phase of assembly to the final product. TofuPilot's sub-unit features enable automatic test traceability through the entire process.

## Integration

You can define `sub_units` in your assembly test as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a sub-unit with the key `serial_number` for its serial number.

## In-app view

You can see in this example the creation of the camera assembly with its sub-units listed as children in the **Units** page. You can navigate to these sub-units using the expansion menu on the left.

On the specific camera assembly **Unit** page, the **Sub-units** section allows you to view and navigate to their individual pages.
