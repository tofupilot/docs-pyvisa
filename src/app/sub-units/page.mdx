# Sub-units

Most hardware products are made of multiple components, tested individually and at each step of assembly to the final product. TofuPilot's sub-unit features enable automatic test traceability through the entire process. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This guide explains how to use TofuPilot's sub-units feature to automatically ensure the traceability of tests and serial numbers throughout the assembly process.

## Test Strategy

### Introduction

A good industrial test strategy relies on several key steps:

- **Early Test Deployment**: Install tests early at the supplier or assembler, matching each assembly stage.
- **Automated Tests**: Prioritize automation to reduce errors and save time.
- **Standardization and Log Collection**: Standardize logs and systematically collect results.

### Flowchart Example

A test flowchart can be created to provide the manufacturing test team with an overview of the product's testbenches.

In this example of a smart-battery testing strategy:

- **PCBA**: a firmware flash and test is performed at the supplier to verify the integrated components (gauge, LEDs...).
- **Chemical Cells**: a test is performed on the battery cells to check voltage levels.
- **Thermal Probes**: no tests are performed for thermal probes that are purchased off-the-shelf.
- **Smart Battery Assembly**: a test is performed after final assembly to ensure proper integration of all components.

## Example

To add sub-units in an assembly test, specify their serial number in the `sub-units` parameter in `create-run`.

```python {{ title: 'create_run_with_sub_units.py'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient

client = TofuPilotClient()

def test_function():
    # your test execution goes here
    return True

run_passed = test_function()

client.create_run(
    procedure_id="FVT3",
    unit_under_test={
      "serial_number": "BAT01-0001",
      "part_number": "BAT01"
    },
    run_passed=run_passed,
    sub_units=[
      {"serial_number": "PCBA01-0001"},
      {"serial_number": "CELL01-0001"},
      {"serial_number": "CELL01-0002"},
      {"serial_number": "CELL01-0003"}
    ]
)
```

## Unit Pages

The battery assembly was created with its sub-units automatically listed as children in the unit list. You can see and navigate to these sub-units using the expansion menu on the left.

On the specific battery assembly page, the **Sub-units** section allows you to view and navigate to their individual pages.
