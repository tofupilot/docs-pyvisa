## Overview
TofuPilot supports real-time and asynchronous uploads, useful when offline during testing or importing past test data.

## Run creation date
Uploading OpenHTF JSON reports is easy and requires just one line. The `start_time_millis` field sets the test creation date.

With the TofuPilot Python Client, you can upload test results, specifying `started_at` to keep the original test date; otherwise, the upload date is used.


<CodeGroup>
```python {{ title: 'OpenHTF'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient

client = TofuPilotClient()

def main():
    file_path = "path/to/your/openhtf/report.json"
    client.create_run_from_openhtf_report(file_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
```python {{ title: 'Python Client'}}
from tofupilot import TofuPilotClient
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

client = TofuPilotClient()

def load_your_results():
  # Convert a date string into a datetime object in the UTC timezone
  date_string = "25-10-2024 14:30"
  started_at = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M").replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)
  return started_at

def main():
  started_at = load_your_results()

  response = client.create_run(
    procedure_id = "FVT1",
    started_at = started_at # datetime object
    unit_under_test = {
      "serial_number": "PCB1A001",
      "part_number": "PCB1",
    },
    run_passed = True,
    attachments=["path/to/your/attachment"],
  )
```

### Example

Uploaded runs appear on the Runs page with their `Uploaded` date. In this example, data from tests done on the same day is uploaded at two-day intervals (yesterday and 1 day ago).

  alt="Runs Page with all Unit Under Testing (UUT) and their uploaded date."
/>


The Run page shows the creation date (October 28th for these runs).
