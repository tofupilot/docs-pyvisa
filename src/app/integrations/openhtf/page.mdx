# OpenHTF Integration

Integrate your OpenHTF scripts with TofuPilot in a single line. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

[OpenHTF](https://openhtf.com) is an open-source Python framework for automating hardware tests. It makes writing and running tests easier with a modular design. Built at Google, it's now used by teams around the world.

With just one line added to your OpenHTF scripts, TofuPilot open-source Python client automatically creates a run on TofuPilot, parsing the test phases, measurements, and attachments, while storing the original OpenHTF JSON log for traceability.

## Installation

1. [Create a TofuPilot account](https://docs.tofupilot.com/user-management#sign-up)

2. [Install OpenHTF](https://openhtf.com/first-test) and create your test script

3. Install the TofuPilot open-source Python client:

```sh
pip install tofupilot
```

Add it to your test like this:

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
import openhtf as htf
from tofupilot.openhtf import TofuPilot

def phase_one(test):
    return htf.PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    test = htf.Test(phase_one)
    with TofuPilot(test):
      test.execute(lambda: "PCB001")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The integration automatically uploads your OpenHTF report to your TofuPilot account using the DUT's serial number `dut_id` and procedure name `test_name`.
