# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the TofuPilot API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. TofuPilot uses OAuth2 authentication with a token. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## OAuth2 with bearer token

The recommended way to authenticate with the TofuPilot API is by using OAuth2. When establishing a connection using OAuth2, you will need your access token — you will find it in the Profile page of your [TofuPilot account](https://tofupilot.com/home) under API settings. Here's how to add the token to the request header using cURL:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with bearer token' }}
curl https://https://tofupilot.com/v1/runs/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.

## Using a client

If you use our official clients, you won't have to worry about any of the above — fetch your access token in the Profile page of your [TofuPilot account](https://tofupilot.com/home) under API settings, and the client library will take care of the rest. All the client libraries use OAuth2 behind the scenes.
