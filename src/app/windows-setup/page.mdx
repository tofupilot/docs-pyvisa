# Windows Setup

## 1. Download the NI-VISA Driver

Registration is needed before download: [NI registration page](https://lumen.ni.com/nicif/us/header_login/content.xhtml?action=create). Then download the [NI Package Manager](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-visa.html).

## 2. Install the NI-VISA Driver

### Fast Startup

The installer will ask you to disable Windows Fast Startup.

On a development laptop, Fast Startup will likely not affect your setup. Fast Startup may prevent some interfaces from fully resetting, causing VISA to detect stale devices. On production machines, disabling Fast Startup is a good idea.

### What to Install
After installing the NI Package Manager, it will ask what package you want.

For debugging, select:
- [x] **NI-VISA Configuration Support** → For viewing/configuring instruments.
- [x] **NI-VISA Interactive Control** → For testing VISA communication manually.

For production environments, uncheck everything and just click next.

The VISA runtime is installed regardless of your selection. You will need to reboot after setup.

## 3. Installing PyVISA

PyVISA supports Python 3.6+.
On Windows, Python is available via the Microsoft Store or can be installed from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloitads/).

### Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional, Recommended)

Get the `virtualenv` package from the command line:
<Code language="sh" code={`pip install virtualenv`} />

Then navigate to your project folder and create the virtual environment:
<Code language="sh" code={`python -m venv .venv`} />

You will have to [change the Windows script execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.5) to be able to activate the virtual environment.

The safest way to do it would be:
<Code language="sh" code={`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`} />
However, it is not the most practical, you must run this command for each new terminal session.

Then enter the virtual environment:
<Code language="sh" code={`.venv\Scripts\activate`} />

### Installing PyVISA

Now you can install PyVISA:
<Code language="sh" code={`pip install pyvisa`} />
If you are using a networked instrument, you will need:
<Code language="sh" code={`pip install psutil zeroconf`} />

Now, open a Python interpreter:
<Code language="sh" code={`python`} />

Then try:
<Code language="python" code={`import pyvisa

rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager()
print(rm.list_resources())`} />

You should get output like this:
<Code language="sh" code={`('ASRL3::INSTR', 'ASRL4::INSTR', 'USB0::VID::PID::SN::INSTR')`} />

In this case, the instrument is using USB.

## Troubleshooting

### Runtime DLL
If your device does not appear, try specifying your VISA runtime DLL:
<Code language="python" code={`rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager("C:/Windows/System32/visa32.dll")`} />

### VISA Version Incompatibility and Conflicts
Manufacturer-specific VISA versions can cause conflicts. The recommendation is to uninstall the manufacturer's version and install the NI version alone.

### Termination Characters
Some instruments require termination characters. Please refer to the [dedicated section](/interfaces#termination-characters) on the Interfaces page.
