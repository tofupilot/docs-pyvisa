# What is PyVISA?

**VISA** (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture) is a universal driver for controlling measuring instruments over various interfaces such as USB, GPIB, Ethernet, and others. It allows you to control instruments using SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) commands. For example, the command `"MEASUREMENT:FREQUENCY?"` retrieves the signal frequency on an oscilloscope.

**PyVISA** is a Python wrapper for the VISA driver, enabling you to control instruments using Python. Here's an example of how to use PyVISA:

<Code language="python" code={`import pyvisa

# The resource manager gives you access to all connected instruments
rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager()

# Open a connection to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = rm.open_resource('INTERFACE::VID::PID::SN::INSTR')  # Instrument's VISA address

# Set time scale to 1 ms/div
oscilloscope.write('HORIZONTAL:SCALE 0.001')

# Set vertical scale for Channel 1 to 1 V/div
oscilloscope.write('CH1:SCALE 1.0')`} />
