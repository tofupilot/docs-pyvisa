## Overview
When testing your product with multiple procedures and phases, it can be challenging to know where to focus your efforts when issues arise or improvements are needed. In TofuPilot, each test step is tracked individually, allowing you to analyze areas that need attention—whether it's phases taking too long, those with low yield, or measurement drifts over time.

## Single step analysis
After a test run, go to the **Phases** table on the **Run page** to see details on the unit under test, procedure, attachments, report, and each test step.

The **Steps** table includes each step’s:
- value
- upper and lower limits
- units (e.g., volts, degrees)
- test status (Pass/Fail)
- duration (milliseconds to hours)

This view lets you analyze each step in detail for a specific run.

<Note>
  Click on a test step in the **Steps** table to go to the Procedure page, where data is sorted by that specific step.
</Note>

## Multiple phases analysis
It's also helpful to get an overview across all executed runs, which you can access on the **Procedure page**. This page provides key indicators in various tabs (e.g., Cpk, yields). Learn more in the [Test analytics](/analytics) section.

On the Procedure page, you can filter the indicators for runs within the same procedure by selecting parameters at the top right:

- Run date
- Unit under test component and revision
- Unit under test batch number

You can also filter by step in the **Steps by failure** or **Steps by duration** tables below.

<Note>
  Click on a step (e.g., "thermal_reading" or "motor_noise") to filter by it. To clear the filter, select **Clear Filter**.

### Steps by failure and Step by duration
This view helps you identify the most frequently failing test phases, making it easier to analyze defective parts or improve test procedures.

The **Steps by failure** table lists phases with a `Fail` status, sorted by frequency (from most to least failures).

The **Steps by duration** table displays phases sorted by `duration`, showing those that take the longest.

### Control chart and histogram
You can explore a specific test step with numerical or string data in the **Control Chart** below the Steps tables.

This chart displays all values for the selected step over time, showing limits, an automatically calculated 6-sigma standard deviation, and the average.

The histogram, with a Gaussian overlay, helps you quickly spot values outside the standard range.

<Note>
  Click on a step with numeric or text values to display the **Control Chart**.
</Note>

### Steps by First-pass yield and Cpk

You can also view the First-Pass Yield and Cpk of each step, helping you easily identify which test needs improvement to boost the overall yield. Keep in mind that the yield of a run is the cumulative result of all step yields.
